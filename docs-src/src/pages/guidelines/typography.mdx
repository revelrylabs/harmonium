## Sizing + line height

- Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size.
- Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size.
- Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size.
- Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

## Header hierarchy

- Every page needs an h1
- The h1 should be the first header on the page
- The h1 should help to describe what the page is about
- If you need a graphical representation for the page header, rather than a generic h1, you should still put an h1 on the page and add the screen-reader class so that the h1 will still get indexed and will still be available for people using screen readers
- H1 - h6 should decrease in visual hierarchy. An easy way to do this is the decrease the font size from h1 to h6, but, depending on fonts and formatting you may need to employ other methods. Regardless, when you view your headers they should visually look like h1 is the most important and h6 is the least important.

## Paragraph widths

- Keep paragraph widths between 50-70 characters per line.
- “Some studies have shown that 100 cpl can be read faster than lines with 25 characters, but the level of comprehension remains the same. In order for on-screen text to have both the best speed and comprehension possible about 55 cpl should be used. Like with printed text if lines are too long or too short it will result in slower reading. If lines are too long it is difficult for the reader to quickly return to the start of the next line (saccade) whereas if lines are too short more scrolling or paging will be required. Research suggests that longer lines are better for quick scanning, but shorter lines are better for accuracy. Longer lines should be used when the information will likely be scanned, while shorter lines should be used when the information is meant to be read thoroughly. Web design is often intended to be read in full rather than skimmed, so shorter lines should be used when possible.”

## Text Resizing

- Text should be able to be resized to 200% without loss of content or function accessibility
