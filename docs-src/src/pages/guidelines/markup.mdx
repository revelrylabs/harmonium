## Conventions

Use SUIT classes (https://suitcss.github.io/) when defining UI components in styles

## Linting

[Lintron](lintron.io) is set up on most of our projects and provides style linting. Make sure to follow it's suggestions. If for some reason you object, leave a comment stating why.

## Accessibility

We adhere to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) [AA](https://www.wuhcag.com/wcag-checklist/) standards for web accessible content. Everything that’s on your website must work to defined standards. Where you’re writing code that’s not HTML, it must conform to HTML-like standards. This means that it will work with various assistive technologies.

## Leave comments

If styles or markup is complex, leave comments so that other can understand why things were done in a specific way

If styles require things like `!important`, extreme nesting, or unconventional methods, there should always be comments explaining why it was necessary
