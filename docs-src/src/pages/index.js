      The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space
      where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
      Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via
      the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide
      Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while
      employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released
      outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in
      January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.

      The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information
      Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the
      Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and
      annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to formatted
      text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components
      that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of
      multimedia content.

    <h3>Revelry<br/>Components</h3>
    <p>
      Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple
      web pages with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a
      website. Website content can largely be provided by the publisher, or
      interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon
      the users or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily
      for entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or
      non-governmental organisational purposes.
