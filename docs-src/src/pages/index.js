          Harmonium is a framework of React components optimized for teams that
          want to ship apps fast. It is a curated list of components that work
          together and have cohesive styles. One of our design goals is that you
          never have to research and handpick component packages. Whatever you
          need is already here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harmonium was built by <a href="https://revelry.co" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Revelry</a>. We&apos;ve been doing React since
          the earliest version was in beta. We&apos;ve built dozens of React apps
          and we&apos;ve learned what works and what doesn&apos;t. And our focus
          is on shipping gold fast. So we never want to solve the same problem
          twice.
        </p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <pre>
          <code className="language-bash">npm install --save harmonium</code>
        </pre>

        <h2>SCSS Setup</h2>
        <p>
          We&apos;ve built a set of SCSS styles for all the components. In order to use Harmonium, make sure
          that your asset compilation pipeline can understand scss files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Import Harmonium's styles into your scss like so:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code className="language-scss">
              {`/* myapp.scss */
@import '~harmonium/scss/app';
/* your styles here; */
`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
        Harmonium includes !default values for color-palette and harmonium-settings vars.
        You can download the starter settings <a href="/settings-templates/settings-templates.zip">here</a> (which include color-palette.scss and harmonium-settings.scss) and easily view/edit variables to fit your project
        </p>
        <p>
        Your style imports would look something like this:
        </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-scss">
              {`/* myapp.scss */
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/color-palette';
@import 'wherever-your-styles-live/harmonium-settings';
@import '~/harmonium/scss/app';

/* your styles here; */
`}
            </code>
          </pre>
        <p>
          For advanced configurations, styles can be found in the <code>scss</code> directory
          of the package. You can either copy it into your project&apos;s SCSS
          directory, or use a tool like{' '}
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sassy-npm-importer">
            sassy-npm-importer
          </a>{' '}
          to import it from the package.
        </p>

        <h2>Usage with React</h2>
        <pre>
            <code className="language-jsx">
              {`import React, {Component} from 'react'
import Row from 'harmonium/lib/Row';
import Col from 'harmonium/lib/Col';
import Button from 'harmonium/lib/Button';

export default class MyComponent extends Component {

  render() {
    return <Row>
    <Col>
      <h3>Hello, world</h3>
    </Col>
    <Col>
      <Button small>Click here</Button>
    </Col>
    </Row>
  }
}
`}
            </code>
          </pre>

          <h2>Usage with HTML</h2>
          <p>
            If you aren't using React,
            you can still take advantage of Harmonium's components
            by adding the proper classes to your markup
          </p>
        <pre>
            <code className="language-html">
              {`<div class="rev-Row">
  <div class="rev-Col">
    <h3>Hello, world</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="rev-Col">
    <button class="rev-Button">Press me</button>
  </div>
</div>`}
            </code>
          </pre>
        <p>
          For more, see the component documentation listed to the left.
        </p>
      </Col>
    </Row>
  </Layout>
}

export default IndexPage
